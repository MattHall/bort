= AASM - Ruby state machines

This package contains AASM, a library for adding finite state machines to Ruby classes.

AASM started as the acts_as_state_machine plugin but has evolved into a more generic library that no longer targets only ActiveRecord models.

AASM has the following features:

* States
* Machines
* Events
* Transitions

== Download

The latest AASM can currently be pulled from the git repository on github.

* http://github.com/rubyist/aasm/tree/master

A release and a gem are forthcoming.



== Installation

=== From GitHub hosted gems

  % sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com # (you only need to do this once)
  % sudo gem install rubyist-aasm

=== Building your own gems

  % rake gem
  % sudo gem install pkg/aasm-2.0.1.gem


== Simple Example

Here's a quick example highlighting some of the features.

  class Conversation
    include AASM

    aasm_initial_state :new

    aasm_state :new
    aasm_state :read
    aasm_state :closed


    aasm_event :view do
      transitions :to => :read, :from => [:new]
    end

    aasm_event :close do
      transitions :to => :closed, :from => [:read, :new]
    end
  end
